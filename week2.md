# Week 2 Reflection

## [Women's Pockets Are Inferior](https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/)

I really like the dynamic visualizations. Most particularly, I liked the beginning when each jean pocket dimension is layered on each other to create the average jean pocket size. Next, I especially liked the overlay of the men's average front jean pocket with the women's average front jean pocket. It provided a really good contrast between the two sizes and help me understand just how dramatic the different is. I also thought the animations gave the whole website a very polished look. 

My favorite visualization was the part labelled "What can actually fit" as I liked the interactability of the different objects as well as how informative it is. However, I disliked where the section where they showed each individual pocket from selected brands. It's nice for people to lookup individual brands that they care about, but I don't think the difference between pocket sizes was clear enough to make the visualization worthwhile. 

Finally, I wish the authors did some data collection and analysis on fake pockets. This is because the number one annoying thing with women's fashion are pockets that are sewed shut and are not even functional, and I think that would be a good discussion to include on the topic of pocket sizes.
