# Week 3 Reflection

## [60 Days in Gaza](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/05/world/middleeast/gaza-60-days.html)

First and foremost, the message behind this visualization is incredibly powerful. This New York Times article is a scrollytelly that tells the story of what it is like to spend 60 days in Gaza. I really liked the transition from a 2d map to a "3d" map as I scrolled. The transition to show locations of damaged buildings was also poignant. This data is probably not easily classifiable since the damaged buildings were from satellite photos, but it would've been interesting to see the types of buildings damaged (schools, hospitals, residential, etc.) I also thought it was effective how the article weaved in pictures and videos of Gaza throughout the visualization. The real media kept the visualization down to earth and impactful. I also liked how they took an anecdotal case study to show the movement of a family in Gaza. The colored arrows, highlighted zones, and verbal descriptors truly emphasized just how far people had to travel and how trapped they were. The only critique I would have is that I would want a scale with the map, especially because the size of the map is changing dynamically as you scroll.
