# Week 4 Reflection

## [You should look at this chart about music genre's](https://pudding.cool/2023/10/genre/)

Instead of being one of Pudding's traditional scrollytelling websites, this article instead uses button presses or arrow keys for discrete and incremental changes. Like most of their scrollytellies, Pudding does a good job narratively guiding you through Spotify's genre data. One control that I didn't expect was that clicking on the left side of the page brought you one "page" back, while clicking on the right side of the page brought you one "page" forward. This was confusing when I tried interacting with their visualizations but was instead forced forward or backward. This also made it difficult to tell whether I could scroll down for more information or not. One thing I enjoyed about this article was the inclusion of actual audio clips from the songs that were referenced. I wished the article went more into how Spotify came up with these new genres, especially their names, but I understand that this insight might not have been available. As the reader, I would've liked to see more time sensitive trend data about the genres. Specifically, I think the interactivity of letting the reader search through a list of genres and see how they rank throughout the years would be interesting. I also would've liked to search up songs to find what genres they fit into.
