## [An Extremely Detailed Map of the 2020 Election](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/upshot/2020-election-map.html)

This is an interactive visualization that shows the 2020 presidential race between Trump and Biden. The main visual is a heatmap of the United States, sequestered mostly into counties. The color of the heatmap changes based on the margin difference, with blue representing Democrat leaning and red representing Republican leaning. When hovering over a county, you can see the exact quantity of votes and percentage for that county. I appreciate that the authors were transparent with their data, especially with all the misinformation that was going around during the 2020 elections. One critique that I have with this visualization is with the heatmap. Since the color represents the marginal difference between the leaders, it looks like Trump received the majority of the votes. Instead, there could be another version of the map where the color is scaled by population. Alternatively, the map could be one scaled by the votes within the electoral college to better understand election outcomes. I thought one of the most interseting insights given by this visualization was the change of vote leanings compared to the 2016 election.
